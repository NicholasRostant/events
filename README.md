Some ideas for potential events and suchlike things.


Open source sprint/hackathon
----------------------------

Get a bunch of people who are somewhat involved in an open source project to
lead and help new people make some contribution to that open source project.
Examples of projects that we can probably get people to help out:

    - OpenStack
    - MediaWiki
    - LibreOffice
